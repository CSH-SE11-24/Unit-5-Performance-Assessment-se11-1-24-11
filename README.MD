Functionality of the website (descriptions of each of the pages and what they do)

The Home page serves as a breakdown of my issue, which is the loneliness epidemic, along with potential health issues and possible solutions. It includes various forms of media aimed at offering people a new perspective on loneliness through art, songs, and movies. When the mouse hovers over the video banner, the video unpauses. Clicking the button brings up a statistic from Harvard. Hovering over 'more ' pops up a description of the selected media piece and why it was chosen. When the mouse hovers over the card image, it changes the card's color.

The 'More Info' page details the factors contributing to the loneliness epidemic. When the mouse hovers over each card, the text and background color change, reverting back when the mouse moves out."


How did JavaScript expand the functionality of your website?

I wanted people to gain a new perspective on the topic, as I believe many people do not take it seriously. That's why, for the Home Page, when the mouse hovers over the image, it changes the background color of the card. I hope this will prompt viewers to hover over it to learn more. When the button is clicked, it brings up a statistic from Harvard. This is important to me because I aim to display facts and statistics, using this website as a learning experience.

What features are you the most proud of?

The video banner was the first thing I did. When I started I knew I wanted a video banner and I wanted it to play when the mouse was over it. It was easier said than done since I couldn't discover a way to turn the image into a video. So I turned the video into a gif but that just made it low quality. Finally, I searched for a way for me to play and pause the video with w3 schools so I just implemented it accordingly in javascript 

What would you add if you had more time?

I would want the page to be responsive and the third card for the homepage to not change size when the mouse is over "more about movie". A page where I site all my sources. I also want the graphs to not be cropped so you can see the full image
