  <h1>Causes</h1>
  <article class = "info" data-icon="ðŸ’µ" style="--c0: #7fc5ae; --c1: #7fc5ae; 
                   --idx: 0">
    <h3>Reason</h3>
    <h4>Money</h4>
    <p>The standard of living is increasing so people need to work extra hours to be able to afford things in the economy. When most people get home they don't have time to socially interact with anyone because they are exhausted or don't have enough money to spend other than the essentials so they don't go out as often since there's no need to. </p>
  </article>
  <article class = "info" data-icon="ðŸ«‚" style="--c0: #ab6ee5; --c1: #9937ee; --idx: 1">
    <h3>Reason</h3>
    <h4>Lack Of Third Places</h4>
    <p>A Third place is a place you hang out at besides home and school/work. It can be a place to socialize and meet new people. The amount of inexpensive third places are low so people tend to stay home </p>

  <article class = "info" data-icon="ðŸ‘¤" style="--c0: #ff0000; --c1: #ff0000; --idx: 2">
    <h3>Reason</h3>
    <h4>Indivdualism</h4>
    <p>In the "Me" decade, Americans shifted their focus from communities toward individualism. The sense of community decreased because people only did things that were in their own best interest. When you're only looking after yourself then it's hard to feel connected to people.</p>
